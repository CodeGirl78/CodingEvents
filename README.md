# CodingEvents
Chapter 20 Exercises

Person class may hold these fields: 
• id (int) -unique user ID 
• firstName (string) -user’s first name 
• lastName (string) -user’s last name 
• email (string) -user’s email (this would also function as their username) 
• password (string) -user’s password

*In addition, this class would also need getters for all of these fields and could have setters for all of the fields with the exception of the id field since it shouldn’t change.

The Person class may have: 
• PersonProfile -a class to get profile information pertaining to the user 
• List eventsAttending –this would store the events that the user chooses to attend

Purpose: 
CodingEvents is a web application to collect information about events.

Current State: 
Current state is useful as a personal use, no user accounts exist.

Future Improvements: 
Implement user accounts, including a Person class and a EventPerson join class to allow for many-to-many relationship between the Events table and the Persons table
